description: A guide to get started with Goat Hooker
---

Goat Hooker is a CLI tool for creating, managing and executing Git Hooks on any project (including monorepos). It also solves the problem of sharing hooks between different contributors by using explicit configuration files to generate hooks. It also offers pre-made hooks that can be imported into configuration files and configured using a few parameters.

## Quick start
### Installation

Install Goat Hooker by running the following commands in your terminal:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Step 1">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zuygui/goat-hooker
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Step 2">
  ```bash
  cargo build --release
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Step 3">
  ```bash
  export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/target/release
  ```
  :::danger
  Remember that the program executable is here and that if you delete the cloned folder, the program will also be deleted and thus unusable.
  :::
  </TabItem>
  
  :::tip
  The project is still on development and a more easy way to install is planed. Just wait for a release to get final installation instructions.

</Tabs>

### Create a configuration file

```yaml

hooks:

    - # Multiple commands
```

### Run hooks

With Goat Hooker, everything is easy to do, so, to run your hooks, just run this command in your shell:
