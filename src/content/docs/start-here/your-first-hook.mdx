title: Your First Hook
description: A guide to setup your first hook
---

Here is a short guide to write your first hook. In this tutorial, we'll implement an hook that lint our Rust code

## Init Goat-Hooker

It's very simple, just run:

```bash
hooker init
```

You should have a new file called `hooker.config.yaml`, it should like something like

```yaml title="hooker.config.yaml"
hooks:
```

## Create a Hook

We want a `pre-commit` hook, a hook that run on `git commit` but before the commit is done.

So let's write it:

```diff lang=yaml title="hooker.config.yaml"
hooks:
+ - pre-commit:
+   - cmd: "cargo clippy --all -- --check"
```

We specify in the `pre-commit` section that we want to define a hook who contain only one command.
In this command, we ask to [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) (a Rust-code linter) to lint our code.

## Install hooks

Goat-Hooker implement a function to install hooks to Git, in only one command:

```bash
hooker install
```

A lot of file should be created in `.git/hooks/` who contain an Goat-Hooker command.

## Test our Hook 

In the case you're not sure about your Hook code,Goat-Hooker provide a command to test your hook(s).

There-is two case:

- First, you want to run all your hooks:

```bash
hooker run all
```

- Second, you want to run a specific event-typed hook:

```bash
hooker run pre-commit
```

Check your code after running one of these commands, your code might be linted.

## Commit

To finish this example, you can go back to an dirty code (just for example) and commit.
Your code might be linted in the commit (you can check if you use Github or anything else).
