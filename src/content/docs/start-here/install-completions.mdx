Some shells offer a completion system for command line tools. GoatHooker, in the spirit of simplicity, has a command to make our tool compatible with your favorite shell.

Our completion generator command support theses shells:
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) 
- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
- [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)
- [Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)
- [Elvish](https://elv.sh/)

Here is command to install completion for your shell

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Bash">
    ```bash
    sudo hooker completion bash
    ```

  :::note
  Bash completion files are located in a restricted folder who require an admin permission, it's why we use the `sudo` command.
  :::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Zsh">
  ```bash
  hooker completion zsh
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Fish">
  ```bash
  hooker completion fish
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Powershell">
  ```bash
  hooker completion powershell
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Elvish">
  ```bash
  hooker completion elvish
  ```
  </TabItem>

  After that, you may need to reload your shell instance or import the completion file into your configuration, but that's out of the scope of our tool and we'll leave you in charge of your machine.
