# Goat Hooker

> Goat Hooker is a CLI tool for creating, managing and executing Git Hooks on any project (including monorepos). It also solves the problem of sharing hooks between different contributors by using explicit configuration files to generate hooks. It also offers pre-made hooks that can be imported into configuration files and configured using a few parameters.
